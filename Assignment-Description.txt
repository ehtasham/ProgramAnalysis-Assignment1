You are to generate the call graph of a single code file (any popular language that allows non-OO code) in the DOT language (which can be visualized using Graphviz) using either flex/bison or Antlr. It is ok to make "some" simplifications (e.g. no templates) but not so much that the programs analyzed do not remain realistic. Ask when in doubt. I'm not looking for perfection in the grammar so take a large code file and test and tweak your grammar against that file. There is no point in taking or comparing against a working grammar from the net
